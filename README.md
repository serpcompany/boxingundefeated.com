NuxtHub creates and manages its own local D1 database in `.data/hub/d1/`. This is the database your app uses during development.


### How to reset and reseed your database in your setup:

1. Delete the SQLite file:
    ```
    rm ./.data/hub/d1/miniflare-D1DatabaseObject/7b8799eb95f0bb5448e259812996a461ce40142dacbdea254ea597e307767f45.sqlite
    ```

2. Run Drizzle migrations:
    ```
    pnpm db:migrate
    ```

3. Start your development server:
    ```
    pnpm dev
    ```

4. Once the server is running, open your application in the browser.
   At the bottom of the page, youâ€™ll see the Nuxt DevTools panel.

5. In Nuxt DevTools, navigate to the **Server Tasks** section.

6. Find and run the `seed` task to populate your database.

(Make sure your .env or .env.local has the correct DRIZZLE_DB_URL.)

To reseed the database, first ensure you have the variables `LIBSQL_CONNECTION_URL` and `LIBSQL_AUTH_TOKEN` in your `.env`; then run:
```
pnpm db:sync:staging
```
